# Aqanta KeyJam

The Aqanta KeyJam is a powerful opensource macro-pad that can be configured to send HID keystrokes, run complex macros on a connected computer, or be used as a drum-pad. 
The KeyJam runs on an RP2040 (Pico) board and can use a companion Electron app for control.

All code, designs, and methodology can be found in this repo. The project is unfinished and will be updated over time.
